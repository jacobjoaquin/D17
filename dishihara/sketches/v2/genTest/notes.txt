1. 2.png and 3.png are the direction that I would
like to explore now. I’d like to make the circles represent campers.
In other words, each circle is a camper and the diameter of each
circle is determined by age (or other parameter) of camper. This
means that total # of circles around 200 all inclusive. I’ll provide
list of 2016 campers. It would be nice to do with 2017 campers but
we can start by testing concept with last year’s info. In 4 colors
option, maybe lighter dots are women and lighter dots are men?

2. For each upcoming tests please do 4 colors and 2 colors versions

3. Show result on medium grey background as this will probably be
the shirt color

notice the lighter orange cluster of dots around the 7. They are
shaping parts of a 2. Also notice the lighter 1 inside the 4. I
like this subtle effect that adds depth, secrecy and a second reading
to the overall design. Just wanted to draw your attention to those
details. Let’s reflect on how we can use this, Since we're trying
to stay at 4 or even 2 colors max we could maybe obtain this effect
by grouping similar sized circles instead of adding 2 more colors.
This relates to 1. above: Disorient is about codes and cyphers.

5. Below is a crude rendering of how I see the design evolving.
About 130 dots there, easy to imagine getting at 200 by filling the
blanks. Let's increase the maximum circle size as shown below to
give more range to the composition.
